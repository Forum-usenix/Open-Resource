I am a student I am not much rich just a low middle class boy I have just completed my 12th and going for B.tech I decided to help my parents and it was the worst decision I could take. I cannot see my parents to work hard and pay for my fees I wanted to change the situation so I decided to do a part time job and I saw a website that provided to do pencil packing job and it was natraj company literally 1st website when you search on google so I contacted him and he said I need to pay 620 rupees and need to send aadhar card and a photo which I did then I thought if 620 are gone I could still recover it somehow which is not a big amount (it is for me still) so transferred him and then he said he needs more 2000 for verification and said it is refundable it's the last time I had doubt still I don't know why I gave it to him then he demanded for 4500 and I was in shock he said it was all for processing and all the amount will be refunded in 3 minutes so I thought if he's gonna refund it then not to worry much still I had doubt and then he asked for 6k then it I complety got to know that this is a scam but I asked for proof and he sent a pdf containing his personal documents and pictures where he worked so I thought this maybe real then I transferred 6k to him then that guy asked again for 8k I got furious and told him to give my money back he said he won't give and I lost my 12k all it was I saved for my expenses I told this at my home everyone was sad and I cried for 2 hours that how can I be that dumb I know it was a scam still I thought I would help my parents I don't know what to do I just don't know how I can recover that amount and how bad was that person he didn't spare students I told him I was a student please try to stop him least other people could be saved if anyone can catch him or stop please do. I wanted to file a cyber complaint but I can't it's India.
