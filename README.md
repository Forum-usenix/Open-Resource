# README

## Project Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of online scam discussions, adhering to the principles of open science to promote reproducibility and collaboration in research. Given the sensitive nature of the data, we have implemented measures to protect the privacy of individuals involved while ensuring research transparency.

## Repository Contents

1. **translate.py**: This script facilitates the translation of text data, enabling the analysis of posts in multiple languages. It is essential for ensuring that diverse scam discussions are accessible for thorough examination.

2. **scam_detection_analysis.py**: This Python script conducts the analysis of collected posts, utilizing predefined criteria to identify and categorize scam-related content. Recently, it has been enhanced to incorporate a large language model (LLM) as a tool for analysis, allowing dynamic prompt generation based on post content. This enhancement aims to improve the accuracy and depth of understanding regarding scam strategies and victim experiences.

3. **282_posts.zip**: This compressed file contains an analyzed subset of 282 posts, selected from a larger dataset of 54,348 collected posts. All identifying information has been removed to uphold ethical standards while providing valuable insights into scam dynamics.

## Data Access and Ethical Considerations

While the original forum data is publicly available, we refrain from releasing the entire dataset to prevent misuse by scammers.
